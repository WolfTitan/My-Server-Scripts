# My-Server-Scripts
When you spin up a new server install, having a solid set of setup scripts saves a ton of time. Here is my script that i run on Debian / Ubuntu server. 

1. Docker
  <p>I. Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization technology. It allows developers to package an application and all its dependencies (code, runtime, system tools,         libraries, and settings) into a single, standardized unit called a container, ensuring it runs consistently across any environment.</p>
